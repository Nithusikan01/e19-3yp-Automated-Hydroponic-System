## Introduction

![logo](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-3yp-Automated-Hydroponic-System/assets/111074993/b2067de8-f540-4b09-bca7-f84b1f668fc4)
The project "IoT-Based Automated Hydroponic System" aims to develop a modern and sustainable approach to hydroponic farming that maximizes efficiency by using technology to monitor and control growth conditions, reducing resource consumption, and enabling users to make data-driven decisions for better crop management.
Customers want fresh, locally grown produce, and hydroponic farming provides an eco-friendly, space-efficient, and resource-saving solution. They are looking for high-quality, user-friendly, and automated hydroponic systems that can be easily monitored and managed remotely to meet their demand for convenience and sustainability.The market for hydroponic systems, particularly in urban and controlled environments, is growing. This presents an opportunity to develop a product 
that is not only cost-effective but also provides value by integrating automation and data-driven insights. Such a product can cater to the increasing demand for sustainable and efficient farming methods while remaining economically viable for both individual consumers and businesses

## Hardware and Software Designs

### Hardware Design

![Untitled Sketch_bb](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-3yp-Automated-Hydroponic-System/assets/111074993/6b776799-3f0d-408c-9f0f-6efabe07d232)


### User Interface (Mobile Application)

Our solution includes a dedicated mobile application, empowering users with continuous access and control over the hydroponic system. This mobile platform ensures round-the-clock interaction and monitoring capabilities, offering users unparalleled convenience and oversight at any hour.

### User Interface (Web Application)

For the web application while logging in the normal user will get the same facilities as the mobile user. But for the admin user, he/she will be able to add the kind of plants we can grow in the hydroponics system and preferred conditions for the plants. The user management and the registering the new system will also handled in the web application

#### Features & Functionalities

- The status of the pumps which are in the reservoir, resources( pH & Nutritional Solution )
- The measurement of the pH level and the TDS value of the reservoir
- The user will also get the details of the pH and nutritional sources in the system
- After the registration by the admin the user can add a new system in his account (in both 
  mobile and web) and he can select the plant he is going to grow in that system
- The user will get the notification about the system when there is an emergency situation l 
  ike continuous change in reading of the floating switch in the reservoir, when the     
  reservoir motor is switched off, and when the sources of the nutritional and pH solutions 
  are over.
- The user is able to switch off the pumps in the system for the maintainance kind of things.
